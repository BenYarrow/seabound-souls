Additionally, the bay is non-tidal so there’s no restrictions on sailing once the wind kicks in. The water temperature typically ranges from around 20°C (68°F) in the early spring (May) to 26°C (79°F) or higher in the peak summer months of July and August. In May and September, you may want to wear a long wetsuit, particularly once the sun sets behind the mountains. But otherwise, boardies and a rash vest is all you’ll need during the summer months.",
