Conversely, when the tide is coming in, the conditions are awesome for effortless sailing. Whilst Langebaan generally experiences a moderate climate, the water is much colder than you'd expect. In the summer months (October to March), water temperatures range from around 15 to 20°C. During the winter season (April to September), temperatures can drop slightly to approximately 12 to 16°C.
