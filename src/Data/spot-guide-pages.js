        waterConditionDetails: ["Langebaan lagoon is protected from the large ocean swells and offers flat water close to the shore, an ideal spot for freestyle. Further out, the conditions become more challenging, although providing fun bump and jump blasting conditions.",
         "One thing to note is that you do have to be mindful of the tide. When the tide is going out, the current becomes exceptionally strong, making sailing in a southeast wind less enjoyable. Conversely, when the tide is coming in, the conditions are awesome for effortless sailing. Whilst Langebaan generally experiences a moderate climate, the water is much colder than you'd expect. In the summer months (October to March), water temperatures range from around 15 to 20°C. During the winter season (April to September), temperatures can drop slightly to approximately 12 to 16°C. We'd advise a 3/2 wetsuit even in the summer months."

This creates ideal conditions for windsurfers looking to progress their sailing or just enjoy cruising around the turquoise blue waters. Winter (April to September) brings reliable north-westerly winds, offering a slightly different but equally enjoyable windsurfing experience.",
        windConditionImage: '',
        windStatisticDetails: "The spot benefits from thermal winds, especially during the warmer months. As the land heats up, it creates a temperature difference between the inland areas and the coast, resulting in the development of additional winds that enhance the overall wind conditions. Wind strength in Langebaan can vary, but it's not uncommon to experience winds ranging from 15 to 30 knots or more. These conditions are particularly appealing to intermediate and advanced windsurfers.",
