                whenToGo: `The best time for windsurfing in Mauritius is from May to November when the southeast trade winds blow steadily, providing excellent conditions for windsurfers. During this period, you can expect consistent wind speeds ranging from 15 to 25 knots. If the wind direction shows Southeast on Windguru, you can add 8-10 knots on the forecast but this rule only applies if the cloud coverage isn’t too high.`,
