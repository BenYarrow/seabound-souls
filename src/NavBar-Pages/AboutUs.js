              Our story
            </h3>
            <p className="text-center">
              Our paths first crossed in the summer of 2019. Rachel was working as a watersports instructor in Vasiliki, Greece, while Ben was indulging his passion for windsurfing at the same resort. 
            </p>
            <p className="text-center">
              We remained in touch after the summer, but as we lived 200 miles apart neither of us envisaged a future relationship. As the pandemic hit in 2020, we decided to spend our time in lockdown together. Despite the challenges, the shared experience brought us closer together and within a matter of weeks, it became evident that our connection was something special.
            </p>
            <p className="text-center">
              As the world gradually reopened, we made some significant life changes. Ben sold his house and moved across the country, where we established a home together. As the travel restriction eased, we were eager to return to the place where we first met. It was during this trip that Ben proposed and Rachel happily accepted.
            </p>
            <p className="text-center">
              When it came to planning our wedding, we knew we wanted an intimate, beach ceremony just the two of us. After researching various destinations, we settled on Le Morne in Mauritius â€” a place known for its warm winds and beautiful beaches. Fast forward to September 2022, and our dream wedding became a reality.
            </p>
            <p className="text-center">
              Now, with our shared passion for travel, we are eager to explore more of the incredible world we call home.
